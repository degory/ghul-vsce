// GenerateGhulResponseFile ships in ghul.runtime 14.3.0+'s build targets
// (degory/ghul#2132) and writes what the build resolved — the compiler options
// with their conditions applied, and one -a flag per reference — as
// response-file text, which is the form the compiler wants anyway. It replaces
// GenerateAssembliesJson and GenerateGhulOptionsJson, which carried the same
// two things as JSON for a reader that then had to turn them back into flags.
//
// An explicit -t: replaces the default target, so this runs that target and
// the chain it depends on — FindReferenceAssembliesForReferences,
// ResolveReferences, ResolveProjectReferences — and stops there. CoreCompile is
// not in that chain, so the project being analysed is resolved but never
// compiled, which is what we want: the analyser reads that project's sources
// itself and has no use for its output assembly.
//
// ResolveProjectReferences does build each referenced project, and that is
// also what we want. A reference is only ever visible to the analyser as
// metadata it reflects over, so an assembly that is absent or out of date is
// not a slower start-up, it is the wrong answer: the analyser reports symbols
// added since the last build as not found, and nothing downstream can tell
// that from the truth.
